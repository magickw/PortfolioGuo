      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="main-subtitle">I am Baofeng Guo (aka Peter), born and raised in China. I hold a Bachelor Degree in Science. 
        I majored in Biology in college and have been working as an English - Chinese medical translator after 
        graduation for more than 14 years. 4 years after moving to the Bay Area and inspired by its entrepreneurial atmosphere, 
        I felt it's about time to make a change by pursuing a coding career. That's how it started. I am now currently trained at  UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development.
